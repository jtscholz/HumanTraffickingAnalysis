      <h1>Visualizing Human Trafficking</h1>
      <p> Even though human trafficking is a worldwide and ongoing issue, it is a highly sensitive topic which makes it difficult for data too be easily accessible and for that reason challenging to analyze. The Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) publishes data from counter-trafficking organizations around the world in order to provide the high-quality information that the public had previously been lacking. This dataset consists of information on 48.8 thousand victims of human trafficking, with more than 150 participant countries and relevant data as of August 3rd, 2020, it provides variables that describes the gender, origin and destination, means of controlling the victim, etc. </p>
      <h2>Purpose of Analysis</h2>
      <p> This analysis is targeted towards anyone who wants to understand the factors of human trafficking better in order to protect themselves, or even a government official who wants to stay updated on ways he/she can put policies in place to prevent human trafficking. The purpose of my visualizations will be to compare different factors of human trafficking to outline major influences that may make a person more susceptible to be a victim of human trafficking, whether by area, gender, or any other factors that seem to be significant.</p>
      <h2 id="ComparingQualities">Comparing Various Qualities of Human Trafficking Victims</h2>
      <p> I wanted to understand the type of qualities that might make a person more susceptible to being a target for human trafficking. In order to do this I created visualizations that measure the amount of human trafficking victims by gender and by age range. This includes a pie chart comparing the total percent of victims that are male verses female. Looking at the pie chart you can see that the majority of victims in the dataset are female, about 73%. It also includes a bar chart that compares the amount of victims in the dataset by age range. As you can see the highest count of victims are in the age range 9-17. Just these two visualizations gives you an idea of the type of qualities a person might have that puts them at higher risk. If you wanted to analyze the data in further detail, you can click on an age range on the bar graph and see the comparison of gender in the pie chart adjust to that specific age range.</p>

      <h2 id="Demographics">Demographics</h2>
      <p>The following choropleths reveal the Demographics of Human Trafficking Victims (by Citizenship and by Country of Exploitation). These are used to highlight the main areas where the issue is most present. It also helps to understand how different laws and policies all around the world can impact such issues. If you click on any of the countries/regions, you can see the number of victims and compare them. </p>

      <h2 id="TypeOfHumanTrafficking">How a Person Becomes a Victim</h2>
      <p>The following bar graph compares the different ways that a victim is recruited, whether by a family member, friend, intimate partner, or other. The bars are sub-sectioned by the type of exploit they are trafficked into. This portrays what malicious relationships victims may be in that are the cause of their trafficking. It also shows the intent the recruiter had when trafficking from sexual abuse to marriage and other forms of forced exploitation.</p>

      <h2 id="DataExtraction">How Data was Extracted</h2>
      <p>The following pie chart outlines the majority of how data from the victims of human trafficking is extracted. It compares the two sources - Case management vs Hotline to emphasize the ways in which these victims report their case. This can be useful for a government official who hopes to encourage more victims to speak up and provide funding/assistance to these organizations. As you can see a majority of data is extracted (about 75 percent) from case management.</p>
